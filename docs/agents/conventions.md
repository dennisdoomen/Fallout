# Conventions

Three groups: conventions to respect, things never to do, and the tool-wrapper recipe.

## Conventions worth respecting

- **Centralized package versions** — add new packages to `Directory.Packages.props`, never inline. Adding a *meaningful* library (not a tiny transitive helper)? Add a row to [docs/dependencies.md](https://github.com/Fallout-build/Fallout/blob/main/docs/dependencies.md) in the same PR — reviewers will ask.
- **Test naming follows AV1600 behavior-focused style.** Write test names as short, present-tense descriptions of observable behavior, not method calls. Example good: `Missing_changelog_does_not_add_a_full_changelog_link_to_release_notes`. Example bad: `GetNuGetReleaseNotes_WithMissingChangelog_AndGitHubRepository_DoesNotThrow`. Focus on "what happens" not "what method is called" (see [AV1600](https://csharpcodingguidelines.com/testability-guidelines/#AV1620)).
- **Test files and classes use `Specs` suffix.** Name test projects `Foo.Specs`, test files `FooSpecs.cs`, and test classes `FooSpecs`. Use `Specs` not `Test` or `Tests` — it clarifies that the class describes the expected behavior (specification) of the subject under test.
- **AAA structure, marked with Pascal-case comments.** Mark the Arrange/Act/Assert sections of a test with `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` comments (not `// ARRANGE` etc.). Omit a section's comment when a test has nothing to arrange (e.g. the fixture already set up in the constructor covers it).
- **Disk-based test fixtures use a constructor + `IDisposable.Dispose()`, not per-test `try/finally`.** xUnit creates a fresh instance per `[Fact]`, so the constructor is the Arrange step for shared setup and `Dispose()` is the teardown — this replaces hand-rolled `try/finally` cleanup in every test. Use `AbsolutePath.Temp(prefix)` to allocate the scratch directory; it returns a unique path under the OS temp directory without creating it. See `MigrationIntegrationSpecs.cs` and `BumpDotNetVersionStepSpecs.cs` for the pattern.
- **Tool wrappers**: copy/paste from neighbours; cover full commands; use `<c>`, `<a>`, `<ul>`/`<ol>`, `<em>`, `<para/>` in `help`; don't write `secret: false` or `default: xxx`. See [Tool wrapper recipe](#tool-wrapper-recipe) below.
- **Tests next to code, separate folder**: every `Foo` project under `src/` has a sibling `Foo.Tests` project under `tests/`. Mirror the namespace.
- **No IDE-specific style files committed.** `.editorconfig` and `*.DotSettings` were removed during the takeover — relying on `dotnet format` defaults and review.
- **No per-file license headers.** The MIT notice lives in [`LICENSE`](https://github.com/Fallout-build/Fallout/blob/main/LICENSE) at the repo root, and NuGet packages declare MIT via `PackageLicenseExpression`. Per-file headers were stripped in v11 (one source of truth + the header URL would have rotted on the repo-org transfer). Vendored third-party code keeps its own copyright headers — don't touch those (e.g. files under `src/Persistence/Fallout.Persistence.Solution/` retain Microsoft's MIT notice).
- **`[Experimental]` for opt-in unstable public APIs.** Not-yet-stable public surface is marked with `[Experimental("FALLOUT0xx")]` rather than held back or shipped silently. See [the `[Experimental]` convention](#experimental-for-opt-in-unstable-apis) below and the [diagnostic-ID registry](../experimental-apis.md).
- **`[Obsolete]` with a `DiagnosticId` for deprecations.** Deprecated public surface carries `[Obsolete(..., DiagnosticId = "FALLOUTOBS0xx")]` so `TreatWarningsAsErrors` consumers can suppress a single deprecation. See [the `[Obsolete]` convention](#obsolete-for-deprecating-public-apis) below and the [diagnostic-ID registry](../obsolete_apis.md).

## Writing style for issues, PRs, and commits

Applies to AI tools and humans. Many readers are non-native English speakers — keep it readable.

- Be short and precise. Lead with the point.
- Prefer bullet points over paragraphs.
- Use plain, simple English. Short sentences, common words.
- Cut filler: no preamble, no hedging, no AI-flavored padding.
- Say what changed and why. Drop the rest.

Covers GitHub issues, PR titles/bodies/comments, and commit messages.

## Glossary of repo jargon

Terms that come up often in issues, PRs, and code comments. Link here (or gloss
the term in one clause) the first time a PR or issue uses one of these —
per [issue-and-pr-style.md](issue-and-pr-style.md), don't assume the reader
already knows the vocabulary.

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Shim** | A small compatibility layer that makes old code keep compiling/working against a new API, without being the real implementation. |
| **Transition shim** | A shim meant to be temporary — it exists only to ease an upgrade and is expected to be removed later. |
| **Sentinel** (e.g. "consumer sentinel") | A small test project whose only job is to fail the build if something regresses — an early-warning check, not a feature. |
| **Canonical type / namespace** | The current, "real" location of a type — as opposed to an old namespace kept alive only by a shim. |
| **Ceiling** (of a shim/fix) | The limit of what a shim or fix covers — what it does *not* handle, so the reader knows when to reach for something else. |
| **Shallow (by design)** | The change intentionally covers only the common case, not every possible scenario. |
| **Blast radius** | How many consumers/how much code is affected by a change. |

## `[Experimental]` for opt-in unstable APIs

Per [ADR-0004 §5](../adr/0004-calendar-versioning-and-dual-pace-channels.md) (channel ladder amended by [ADR-0008](../adr/0008-collapse-experimental-into-main.md)), public APIs that aren't ready to commit to a stability guarantee are marked with [`System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.ExperimentalAttribute`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.codeanalysis.experimentalattribute) instead of being held back or shipped silently. The attribute ships in the .NET 8+ BCL — **no package reference needed** (the repo targets .NET 10).

```csharp
using System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis;

[Experimental("FALLOUT001")]
public sealed class NewPluginHost
{
    // ...
}
```

**Rules:**

- **Diagnostic-ID scheme: `FALLOUT0xx`.** Each experimental surface gets its own ID (e.g. `FALLOUT001`), allocated **sequentially and never reused** — a retired ID stays retired. Register every allocation in the [diagnostic-ID registry](../experimental-apis.md) in the same PR that introduces it.
- **Consumers must explicitly opt in.** `ExperimentalAttribute` is an *error-by-default* diagnostic: code that touches the API fails to compile until the consumer suppresses the exact ID — `#pragma warning disable FALLOUT001` around the call site, or `<NoWarn>$(NoWarn);FALLOUT001</NoWarn>` in their project. Opting into instability is therefore a conscious, per-API choice — which is right for a *framework* (a product devs build on), not an app.
- **Promoting to stable = removing the attribute.** Because the feature already rode the `main` test lane, deleting the `[Experimental]` line is the whole promotion — no special cross-branch dance. This is what lets stabilised work feed into the production line without a divergent fork. Adding *or* removing `[Experimental]` is **not** a breaking change.
- **Channel discipline differs.** On the `main` (preview) test lane, churn is expected and the attribute is a courtesy. On a `release/YYYY` **production line**, any risky-but-shipped public surface **must** wear `[Experimental]` — that contract is what keeps the stable line trustworthy while still carrying new work. With the `experimental` branch retired ([ADR-0008](../adr/0008-collapse-experimental-into-main.md)), `[Experimental]` is now the primary mechanism for isolating unstable surface on `main` — including breaking changes batched toward the yearly major.
- **Don't apply it speculatively.** Because the diagnostic is error-by-default, marking an API that's already used internally breaks the build everywhere it's referenced. Only add `[Experimental]` to a genuinely not-yet-stable API, and suppress every internal usage in the same change so the build stays green.

## `[Obsolete]` for deprecating public APIs

When a public API is on its way out, mark it with [`System.ObsoleteAttribute`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.obsoleteattribute) and give it a `DiagnosticId`. This is the sanctioned deprecation path under [AGENTS.md rule #2](https://github.com/Fallout-build/Fallout/blob/main/AGENTS.md/AGENTS.md) — keep the old surface working (usually bridging to the replacement) while steering consumers to the new one. `DiagnosticId`/`UrlFormat` ship in the .NET 5+ BCL — **no package reference needed** (the repo targets .NET 10).

```csharp
using System;

[Obsolete(
    "Use [GitHubActionsInputAttribute] instead. Removed in 2027.x.x.",
    DiagnosticId = "FALLOUTOBS001",
    UrlFormat = "https://github.com/Fallout-build/Fallout/blob/main/docs/obsolete_apis.md")]
public string[] OnWorkflowDispatchOptionalInputs { get; set; } = new string[0];
```

**Rules:**

- **Adding `[Obsolete]` is not a breaking change.** It's warning-level by default, so existing code keeps compiling — this is why it's preferred over a hard break. The *removal* is the break, and it's batched to the next yearly major. State the removal target in the message (e.g. `Removed in 2027.x.x.`).
- **Always set a `DiagnosticId`.** Without one the compiler reports the generic `CS0618`, so a `TreatWarningsAsErrors` consumer can only fix every usage at once or blanket-`NoWarn` all deprecations. A per-deprecation `FALLOUTOBS0xx` ID lets them suppress just this one while they migrate.
- **Diagnostic-ID scheme: `FALLOUTOBS0xx`.** Allocated **sequentially and never reused**, from a sequence **separate** from the `FALLOUT0xx` used by `[Experimental]`. Register every allocation in the [diagnostic-ID registry](../obsolete_apis.md) in the same PR that introduces the attribute.
- **Keep the deprecated surface functional.** Prefer bridging the old member to the new one (e.g. fold legacy arrays into the typed replacement) over leaving it inert, and suppress the internal bridge usage with `#pragma warning disable` scoped to the exact ID.

## CI pipeline & triggers

Shaped by [milestone #18](https://github.com/Fallout-build/Fallout/milestone/18) and the [ADR-0004](../adr/0004-calendar-versioning-and-dual-pace-channels.md) ladder (amended by [ADR-0008](../adr/0008-collapse-experimental-into-main.md), which collapsed `experimental` into `main`). Invariants:

- **Feature branches run zero CI until a PR is opened.** Push triggers list **only** long-lived branches; nothing fires on `feature/*`, `bugfix/*`, etc. until they're PR'd against `main`/`release/*`/`support/*`. Do **not** add a working-branch pattern to any `OnPush*`/`branches:` trigger.
- **The Linux PR gate (job `ubuntu-latest`, from `build.yml`) is the only required check** — runs on PRs to the long-lived branches. (Branch protection keys on the job name, not the workflow file.)
- **`main` (push) → `-preview`** to GitHub Packages (`publish-packages-preview.yml`) — the sole continuous publisher now that `experimental.yml` is deleted.
- **Cross-platform `windows`/`macos` are gated to release intent** — one `build-cross-platform.yml` workflow (a job per OS), firing on PR-to-`release/*`/`support/*` or a `v*` tag push only. They do **not** run on `main` pushes. ("On `main` we've got our edge.")
- **`concurrency: cancel-in-progress` on every build workflow except `publish-packages-release.yml`** — never cancel a publish mid-flight.
- **Canonical CI-ignore paths:** `docs/**`, `.assets/**`, `**/*.md` — applied to every PR/push trigger.
- The `build.yml` (Linux gate) and `build-cross-platform.yml` (macOS+Windows) workflows are **generated** from `build/Build.CI.GitHubActions.cs` — edit the attributes + constants there and regenerate (`./build.sh`), never hand-edit the `.yml`. `build-skip.yml`, `publish-packages-preview.yml`, and `publish-packages-release.yml` are hand-written.
- **Every publishing lane runs `Test` before it publishes** (#324). `publish-packages-preview.yml` and `publish-packages-release.yml` both run a single `dotnet fallout Test Pack` invocation — NUKE executes it as discrete internal stages (Restore → Compile → Test → Pack) and fails at the breaking stage, so a test failure stops the job before the push step. Don't split a lane into separate `dotnet fallout Compile`/`Test`/`Pack` steps — each invocation re-runs the dependency graph (double-compile); the single invocation *is* the staged build.
- **Caching** (#328): every workflow caches `~/.nuget/packages` + `.fallout/temp`, keyed on `global.json` + `**/*.csproj` + `Directory.Packages.props` (the dependency-affecting set), with a `restore-keys:` prefix fallback for partial restores. There is no `packages.lock.json` to add to the key, and build outputs (`bin`/`obj`) are deliberately **not** cached (stale-artifact correctness risk).

## What not to do

- **Never ping the former NUKE maintainer, Matthias Koch (GitHub handle `matkoch`).** He no longer maintains this project and does not want the notifications. Do **not** `@`-mention him (never write `@` before his handle — not in issues, PRs, comments, commit messages, *or* committed files), add him as a PR/issue reviewer or assignee, request his review, tag him in issue/PR/commit-comment text, or add him as a commit co-author or `Co-authored-by:` trailer — on any GitHub surface, from any AI tool. When you need to credit NUKE's origin, use his name or a plain profile link (`https://github.com/matkoch`) — just never with a leading `@`, which is what fires a mention.
- Don't reintroduce `source/` — production code lives under `src/`, tests under `tests/`. Same for `images/` (now `.assets/`).
- Don't add `main` (or any working-branch pattern) to the **push** triggers of the cross-platform workflows — they're release-intent-gated on purpose (milestone #18 / #318 / #326).
- Don't add `submodules: recursive` to checkouts — there are no submodules (no `.gitmodules`); it's a dead init step.
- Don't add `secret`/`default` defaults to tool JSON files (see CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Don't introduce a new test framework or assertion library — stay on xUnit + FluentAssertions + Verify.
- Don't commit `output/` or any `bin/`/`obj/` directory.
- Don't commit `fallout-global.sln` or other `fallout-global.*` files — they're generated by `GenerateGlobalSolution`.
- Don't bypass `Directory.Packages.props` or `Directory.Build.targets`.
- Don't reintroduce `.editorconfig` or `*.DotSettings` without a maintainer-level decision — they were intentionally removed.

## Tool wrapper recipe

When asked to add or extend a tool wrapper:

1. Find the closest existing tool under `src/Fallout.Common/Tools/<Tool>/<Tool>.json`.
2. Copy its shape; cover a full command with all arguments.
3. Run `./build.ps1 GenerateTools` to regenerate the `.cs` output.
4. Commit the regenerated `.cs` output alongside the `.json` spec — `VerifyGeneratedTools` fails CI if they drift.
