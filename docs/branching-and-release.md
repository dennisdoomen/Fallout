## Branches at a glance

A three-tier maturity ladder feeding the production line (amended [ADR-0004](adr/0004-calendar-versioning-and-dual-pace-channels.md), 2026-05-30):

| Branch | Purpose | Lifetime | Protected | Source of releases? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `experimental` | **Fast / AI lane.** Per-commit `…-alpha` prereleases to GitHub Packages. Intentionally unstable; breaking work accumulates here for the yearly major. | Long-lived | Yes | **Alpha only** (GitHub Packages, no nuget.org / no GH Release) |
| `main` | **Integration trunk + `-preview` channel.** Default branch. Deliberate improvements + bug fixes land here; non-breaking work is promoted up from `experimental`. Pushes publish `…-preview` prereleases to GitHub Packages. **Never nuget.org.** | Long-lived | Yes | **Preview only** (GitHub Packages, no nuget.org / no GH Release) |
| `release/YYYY` | **Production line** for the calendar year (e.g. `release/2026`), cut from `main`. `-rc.N` → GA. Non-breaking minors/patches only after the cut. | Long-lived per year | Yes | **Yes** — tags pushed here fire the full release pipeline (nuget.org opt-in) |
| `support/v10` (+ `hotfix/v10.1`, `hotfix/v10.2`) | **Legacy** semver `10.x` maintenance line — security/critical fixes only. (Renamed from `release/v10`.) | Long-lived | Yes | Yes — tags fire the pipeline (nuget.org opt-in) |
| `support/YYYY` | **Retired** year production line (e.g. `support/2026` once 2027 supersedes it). Security/critical fixes only. | Long-lived | Yes | Yes — tags fire the pipeline (nuget.org opt-in) |
| `release/v11` | **Retired** — nothing clean shipped; work re-homed onto `2026`. Kept for archaeology, marked EoL. Not renamed to `support/` (not a maintained line). | Frozen | Yes | No |
| `feature/<slug>`, `bugfix/<slug>`, `chore/<slug>`, `docs/<slug>`, `pr/<num>-<slug>` | Working branches | Short-lived; PR-and-merge then deleted | No | No |

This *is* gitflow with the project's vocabulary: `experimental` ≈ `develop`, `main` ≈ the stable trunk, `release/YYYY` ≈ `release/*` (long-lived per year), `support/*` ≈ legacy/retired lines. The one deviation: **`main` is not the production/nuget.org line** — `release/YYYY` + `support/*` are. `main` is a `-preview` test channel that production is cut from.

`develop` (literal) and `master` are not used. **Breaking changes land on `experimental` only** and are batched to the yearly major cut. Non-breaking work is promoted **forward-only** `experimental → main → release/YYYY`. A stable-urgent fix lands on `main` (or the production branch) and is **forward-ported to `experimental`** so the fast lane never regresses — see the [promotion + hotfix flow](#promotion-and-hotfixing) below.

CI providers in use: **GitHub Actions only** (the others were dropped — see [#8](https://github.com/ChrisonSimtian/Fallout/issues/8) for the demand-driven revival roadmap).

### Branch protection

`experimental`, `main`, every `release/YYYY` and every `support/*` branch share `main`'s protection profile:

- Required status check: `ubuntu-latest`
- Linear history required (no merge commits)
- CODEOWNER review required
- Dismiss stale approvals when new commits land
- Direct pushes blocked (PRs only)
- Force-push and branch deletion blocked
- Conversation resolution required
- Admins not enforced (admins can bypass in emergencies)

Apply to a new branch by mirroring `main`'s protection JSON via the GitHub API, or via repo Settings → Branches.

## Versioning

**Calendar versioning: `YYYY.MINOR.PATCH`** (see [ADR-0004](adr/0004-calendar-versioning-and-dual-pace-channels.md)). It is mechanically valid SemVer 2.0 — all three components are numeric — so [Nerdbank.GitVersioning](https://github.com/dotnet/Nerdbank.GitVersioning), NuGet and version ordering all work unchanged. The major *is* the calendar year.

- **`MAJOR` = year**, hand-set in `version.json` at the yearly cut. **`MINOR`** = feature drop within the year. **`PATCH`** = git-height fixes.
- Configured per-branch via `version.json`. The test lanes are **non-public refs** carrying the next planned version with a prerelease tag: `experimental` → `"2026.1.0-alpha.{height}"`, `main` → `"2026.1.0-preview.{height}"` (same core; `firstUnstableTag` is `alpha` / `preview` respectively). Each `release/YYYY` carries `"version": "YYYY.x"`; `support/v10` keeps `"version": "10.x"`; `support/YYYY` keeps `"version": "YYYY.x"`.
- `publicReleaseRefSpec` matches the three production patterns — `^refs/heads/release/\d{4}$`, `^refs/heads/support/\d{4}$`, `^refs/heads/support/v\d+$` — and deliberately **not** `main` / `experimental`.
- Test-lane builds carry the height and commit in the **prerelease segment** (`2026.1.0-alpha.<height>.g<commit>`), never in the version core — a core like `2026.05.29` would parse as a *stable* release, not a nightly. Both lanes are non-public refs, so NB.GV appends the `.g<commit>` suffix.

GitVersion is still installed as a transitional helper for `MajorMinorPatchVersion` in `Build.cs`; full removal is a follow-up.

### Versioning policy

**Breaking changes are batched to the yearly major cut.**

- A breaking change may land on **`experimental` only**. It does *not* bump `version.json`'s major mid-year; it is held for the next yearly major and recorded in `CHANGELOG.md` under the next-major `[Unreleased]` heading with a migration path.
- **Neither `main` nor a `release/YYYY` production line takes a breaking change mid-year** — both are strictly non-breaking (minor = features, patch = fixes).
- Surface that isn't ready to commit to can ship behind `[Experimental("FALLOUT0xx")]` instead of being held back. Adding or removing that attribute is not a breaking change. See the [`marking-experimental-apis` skill](../.agents/skills/marking-experimental-apis/SKILL.md).

The definition of "breaking", the labels, and the reviewer's responsibility to block a mis-targeted PR are in the [`creating-a-pr` skill](../.agents/skills/creating-a-pr/SKILL.md).

### Milestones and version targeting

Milestones are **theme-based** (e.g. "Plugin Architecture Foundation & Rebrand Completion", "Public Plugin SDK") and carry across releases. Version targeting uses **`target/YYYY`** labels — `target/2026`, `target/2027`, … Legacy v10 maintenance work uses `target/v10`. Because a breaking change is held for the next yearly major, its PR carries `target/<next-year>`.

## Channel taxonomy

Releases fire to multiple channels, each with its own GitHub Environment:

**GitHub Packages = the test/preview channels; nuget.org = production.** The version ladder orders cleanly under SemVer: `…-alpha.N` < `…-preview.N` < `…-rc.N` < `…` (GA).

| Channel | Built from | Cadence | Gating | Version shape |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **alpha** → `github-packages` env | `experimental` | Per-commit | None | `2026.1.0-alpha.<height>.g<commit>` |
| **preview** → `github-packages` env | `main` | Per-commit | None | `2026.1.0-preview.<height>.g<commit>` |
| **stable** → `nuget-org` env | `release/YYYY` tags | Slow, deliberate | **Flag opt-in + approval-gated** | `2026.1.3` (CalVer) |
| **stable/legacy** → `github-packages` env | `release/YYYY`, `support/*` tags | Every tag | None | CalVer / `10.x` |
| **legacy** → `nuget-org` env | `support/v10`, `support/YYYY` tags | Security/critical only | **Flag opt-in + approval-gated** | `10.x` / `YYYY.x` |
| `github-releases` env (bundled) | `release/*`, `support/*` tags | Same tag as the package publish | None | Same as the tag |
| Docker local NuGet server | Per-PR / per-commit | None (local) | PR-derived | Available via `tests/integration/docker-compose.yml` |

**Defaults:** `experimental` (alpha) and `main` (preview) publish to GitHub Packages only — **never nuget.org, never a GH Release**. Production tag pushes (`release/YYYY`, `support/*`) publish to GitHub Packages + GitHub Releases. nuget.org is **always opt-in** via the `workflow_dispatch` `publish-to-nugetorg` flag — used when a `release/YYYY` is stabilised enough for the broader consumer audience, or for a `support/v10` security patch. See [`project_release_channels` in agent memory](https://github.com/ChrisonSimtian/Fallout/issues/267#issuecomment-4570408325) and [ADR-0004](adr/0004-calendar-versioning-and-dual-pace-channels.md).

## Cutting a release

### Routine stable release (GitHub Packages only)

The default path. Pushing a `v2026.1.X` tag to `release/2026` publishes to GitHub Packages + GitHub Releases. nuget.org is **not** touched. (Git tags keep the `v` prefix — `v2026.1.3` — so the `v*` tag-protection ruleset and `validate-ref` apply; the package version core is `2026.1.3`.)

```bash
# 1. Make sure your local release/YYYY is up to date
git fetch
git switch release/2026
git pull --ff-only

# 2. (Optional) Verify what version NB.GV will compute
dotnet nbgv get-version   # should report 2026.1.X clean, no -g<sha>

# 3. Create the tag + GitHub Release in one step
gh release create v2026.1.X \
    --target release/2026 \
    --title "v2026.1.X" \
    --generate-notes
```

That tag push triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

1. **`validate-ref`** confirms the tag points at a commit reachable from a production branch (`release/YYYY` or `support/*`).
2. **`test-and-pack`** runs `dotnet fallout Test Pack`, uploads `output/packages/*.nupkg` as an artifact.
3. Three parallel publish jobs consume the artifact:
   - `publish-nuget-org` — **skipped** (not opt-in by default)
   - `publish-github-packages` — pushes **all** `*.nupkg` (Fallout.* + Nuke.*) to GitHub Packages
   - `publish-github-releases` — attaches all `*.nupkg` to the GitHub Release page

### Stabilised release (nuget.org publish)

When a `release/2026` release is stabilised enough for nuget.org, or for cutting a `support/v10` legacy security patch, use `workflow_dispatch` with the opt-in flag:

```bash
# Option A: via gh CLI
gh workflow run release.yml \
    -f tag=v2026.1.X \
    -f publish-to-nugetorg=true

# Option B: via Actions UI → release → "Run workflow" → set publish-to-nugetorg to true
```

The workflow:

1. Skips `validate-ref` (workflow_dispatch doesn't auto-validate the ref; you took the action consciously).
2. Re-runs `test-and-pack` against the named tag.
3. **`publish-nuget-org` fires** — pauses for approval at the `nuget-org` env gate (notification + entry on the run page; click "Review deployments" → check `nuget-org` → "Approve and deploy"). Then pushes Fallout.* to nuget.org.
4. `publish-github-packages` re-runs idempotently (`--skip-duplicate` skips what's already there).
5. `publish-github-releases` re-runs idempotently (uses `--clobber` for asset replacement if the GH Release already exists).

Two layers of safety on the nuget.org path: the flag opt-in + the env approval. You can also test the wiring without burning a release — set the flag, get the approval prompt, then cancel without approving.

### If a publish fails partway through

Each `dotnet nuget push` uses `--skip-duplicate`. Re-running a publish job is idempotent on packages already pushed. For a transient failure mid-publish:

```bash
# Routine re-run — leave publish-to-nugetorg false
gh workflow run release.yml -f tag=v2026.1.X

# Stabilised re-run — include the flag if you want to retry the nuget.org push
gh workflow run release.yml -f tag=v2026.1.X -f publish-to-nugetorg=true
```

## Promotion and hotfixing

The ladder flows **forward-only**: `experimental → main → release/YYYY`. Two routine directions plus the legacy case.

### Promoting non-breaking work `experimental → main`

Most work lands on `experimental` (the fast lane). Non-breaking changes that are ready for the deliberate trunk are promoted to `main` — cherry-pick the relevant commits (or merge, if `experimental` carries only non-breaking work since the last promotion) onto a branch and PR it against `main`. Breaking work is **not** promoted mid-year; it waits on `experimental` for the yearly cut.

```bash
git fetch
git switch -c promote-XXXX-to-main main
git cherry-pick <non-breaking-sha-on-experimental> [<sha> …]
git push origin HEAD
gh pr create --base main ...   # ordinary review tier
```

### Promoting `main → release/YYYY` (a stable patch/minor)

A stabilised non-breaking change on `main` is promoted to the production line, then tagged.

```bash
git fetch
git switch -c promote-XXXX-to-2026 release/2026
git cherry-pick <sha-on-main> [<sha> …]
git push origin HEAD
gh pr create --base release/2026 ...   # rigorous review tier
# once merged:
gh release create v2026.1.X+1 --target release/2026 --generate-notes
```

### Forward-porting a stable-urgent fix

If a fix must land on the production line first (prod-down), land it on `release/2026` (or `main`), then **forward-port** to `main` and `experimental` so the upper lanes never regress:

```bash
git switch -c forward-port-XXXX experimental
git cherry-pick <fix-sha>
git push origin HEAD
gh pr create --base experimental ...
```

### Legacy `support/v10`

A `support/v10` security/critical fix that doesn't apply to the current line (the code has moved on) lands **directly** on `support/v10` (or the relevant `hotfix/v10.x`) via PR — the expected path for a maintenance line, not the exception. Such a release is the nuget.org case (use the opt-in flag). The same applies to a retired `support/YYYY` line.

> Even one-commit cherry-picks go through a PR — branch protection blocks direct pushes and requires the `ubuntu-latest` status check on every protected branch.

## Cutting a new year (the yearly major)

At the yearly major cut, the outgoing year's production line is retired to `support/YYYY` and a new `release/YYYY` is cut from `main`. The accumulated breaking work on `experimental` becomes the new year's major.

```bash
# 1. Retire the outgoing production line: rename release/2026 → support/2026
#    (GitHub Settings → Branches → rename, or via API). It keeps taking
#    security/critical fixes only from here on.

# 2. Cut the new production line from main
git fetch
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
git switch -c release/2027 main
git push -u origin release/2027

# 3. Apply branch protection (mirror main's profile — see "Branch protection"
#    above). NOTE: scripts/release-branch-protection.json does not exist yet;
#    capture main's live protection JSON into it (or apply via Settings → Branches).
gh api -X PUT repos/ChrisonSimtian/Fallout/branches/release/2027/protection \
    --input scripts/release-branch-protection.json

# 4. On release/2027 (the branch itself), set version.json "version": "2027.0".
#    publicReleaseRefSpec already matches "^refs/heads/release/\\d{4}$" — confirm
#    it resolves so NB.GV produces clean versions, not git-sha-suffixed.
#    Commit via PR targeting release/2027.

# 5. Roll the test lanes forward so their prereleases sort above the new production
#    line. Merge experimental's accumulated breaking work into main, then bump cores:
#      - main/version.json         → "2027.1.0-preview.{height}"
#      - experimental/version.json → "2027.1.0-alpha.{height}"   (or further ahead)
#    Keep experimental and main on the SAME core (see ADR-0004 §2) so
#    alpha < preview ordering stays honest.
```

### Step 4 — why on `release/2027`, not `main`

`publicReleaseRefSpec` is per-branch. The CalVer ref pattern (`^refs/heads/release/\d{4}$`) matches `release/2027` automatically, but the `"version"` field is per-branch: `release/2027` pins `"2027.0"` (a public ref → clean versions) while `main`/`experimental` move on to the next preview/alpha target. This keeps the production line's number stable and avoids a patch-height collision with the test lanes.

## Deprecating a `support/*` line

Once a `support/YYYY` or `support/v10` line hits end-of-life:

1. Final patch release.
2. Announce EoL in the README + CHANGELOG.
3. Leave the branch in place — don't delete it. Future archaeology + historical hotfix-on-demand should remain possible (this is why `release/v11` stays around despite being retired).
4. Optionally apply a more restrictive protection profile (e.g. require admin approval on every merge) to make accidental tags less likely.

Branches are cheap. Deletion is destructive. Default to keeping.

## Tag protection

A repository ruleset blocks creation/deletion/update of tags matching `v*` for non-admins ([ruleset 17017817](https://github.com/ChrisonSimtian/Fallout/rules/17017817)). Bypass actors: repo admins (`RepositoryRole 5`). Combined with the `nuget-org` env approval gate, that's two layers of "who can fire a production release."

## The nuget.org path

### Why it stays opt-in

**GitHub Packages is the default channel** — for the test lanes (alpha/preview) and for stable tag pushes alike. nuget.org is reserved for the deliberate publish of a stabilised `release/YYYY`, or a `support/v10` legacy security patch. Publishing there requires a `workflow_dispatch` run with `publish-to-nugetorg=true` — a conscious "this release is ready" switch. Tag pushes alone publish to GitHub Packages + GitHub Releases only.

Three layers protect the path: the `v*` tag ruleset, the input flag, and the `nuget-org` environment's required-reviewer rule. `NUGET_API_KEY` is scoped to that environment (per [#273](https://github.com/ChrisonSimtian/Fallout/issues/273)) and only resolves inside the gated job. Prefix reservation is tracked in [#33](https://github.com/ChrisonSimtian/Fallout/issues/33).

### `workflow_dispatch` inputs

- `tag` (required) — the existing tag to (re-)release.
- `publish-to-nugetorg` (boolean, default `false`) — opt into the nuget.org publish job for this run.

### `Nuke.*` shims never go to nuget.org

The `Nuke.*` transition-shim package IDs are owned by the original NUKE maintainer on nuget.org (see [#47](https://github.com/ChrisonSimtian/Fallout/issues/47)). They are permanently routed to GitHub Packages, regardless of the input flag.

### Adding a new `Fallout.X` package — the first-publish 403

nuget.org's `Fallout.*` prefix reservation is per-ID, not per-prefix-wildcard. CI's first `nuget push` for any never-published `Fallout.X` package ID returns `403 (does not have permission to access the specified package)` until someone manually web-uploads one nupkg to register the ID. Two traps when doing that upload:

1. **Set the package owner to the org, not your personal account.** The nuget.org upload UI doesn't prompt you; ownership defaults to the uploading user's profile. Get it wrong and the package ID is reserved but the org's `NUGET_API_KEY` still 403s on subsequent pushes, because the key is scoped to org-owned packages. Fix via *Manage Package → Owners → Add owner → \<org\>*, then optionally remove your personal account — or upload with the org service account's credentials in the first place. See [#208](https://github.com/ChrisonSimtian/Fallout/issues/208) for what this looks like when it goes wrong.
2. **Validation can lag the upload by 5–30 minutes.** The package page may say "approved" while the API-key permission hasn't propagated yet. Wait, then rerun the release pipeline (`gh run rerun <id> --failed`); `--skip-duplicate` makes the retry safe for already-published packages.

### Channel philosophy

Per [RFC #267](https://github.com/ChrisonSimtian/Fallout/issues/267): nuget.org = production-grade and slow; GitHub Packages = faster cadence (the test/preview channel — alpha, preview, and every tag's packages); GitHub Releases = bundled artifacts. A Tier 3 Docker-based local NuGet server for pre-merge testing shipped via [#279](https://github.com/ChrisonSimtian/Fallout/issues/279) — see `tests/integration/docker-compose.yml`.
